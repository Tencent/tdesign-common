> CountDown is used to display the countdown value in real time. If you need to maintain the consistent font style of numbers with the site's design, we recommend downloading the TCloudNumber font from the "Number Font" section of <a href="https://tdesign.tencent.com/design/fonts">fonts</a>, and importing the TCloudNumberVF.ttf font resource into your project for use.
